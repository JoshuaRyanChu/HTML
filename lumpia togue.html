        <p> INSTRUCTION
            <ol>
                <li>In a skillet over medium heat, heat about 1 tablespoon oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until limp</li>
                <li>Add diced pork and cook until lightly browned</li>
                <li>Add fish sauce and cook for about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add water and bring to boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 7 to 10 minutes
                     or until pork is tender and liquid is absorbed.</li>
                <li>Add shrimps and cook, stirring occasionally, just until color changes to pink.</li>
                <li>Add carrots and green beans. Cook, stirring regularly, for about 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are halfway done. </li>
                <li>Add beans sprouts and cook, gently tossing to combine,
                     for about 30 to 40 seconds or just until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Immediately remove vegetable mixture from heat and drain in a colander. Refrigerate for a few minutes to completely cool.</li>
                <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets. On a flat working surface, lay wrapper like a diamond.</li>
                <li>Spoon about 2 tablespoons of vegetable mixture on the middle of the wrapper.
                     Fold the bottom pointed end of wrapper over filling.
                      Fold side ends of the sheet inward and roll tightly into a log.
                       Wet the pointed edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.
                     Repeat with the remaining vegetable mixture.</li>
                <li>In a skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 inches deep of oil. Add spring rolls seam side down and fry, turning once or twice,
                     for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove from pan and drain on a wire rack. Serve immediately with spiced vinegar dip.</li>
